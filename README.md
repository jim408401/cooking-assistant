# Cooking Voice Assistant

## Project Overview

An intelligent, voice-driven cooking assistant that seamlessly combines three core functionalities—recipe discovery, real-time pantry management, and hands-free cooking guidance. Leveraging Azure Cognitive Services for robust intent recognition and Speech-to-Text (STT), this app empowers home cooks to:

- **Search** for recipes based on available ingredients in the fridge  
- **Manage** pantry inventory (check stock, add or remove items)  
- **Navigate** and **read aloud** each step of a recipe  
- **Generate** contextual shopping lists when ingredients run low  

By unifying recipe lookup, fridge inventory tracking, and step-by-step voice guidance into a single interface, users can stay focused on cooking—no more fumbling with screens or recipe cards.

## Features
